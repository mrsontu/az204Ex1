This repository contains the exercise starter code and the solution for the "Azure Applications" course. 

Use the following steps to create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). It will help you install the packages specific to the Python version mentioned in the first command below. Also, the packages you install will not interfere with your existing packages. For example, you can have `Jinja2==3.0.3` in the virtual environment and a lower version in your native local machine. 

## Mac/Linux
Step 1. Create a virtual environment with the name **py3.10**. 
```
python3.10 -m venv py3.10
```

Step 2. Activate the environment.
```
source py3.10/bin/activate
```

Step 3. You can deactivate the Python virtual environment when you finish your exercises. 
```
deactivate
```

## Windows 

Step 1. Create a virtual environment with the name **py3.10**. 
```
python3.10 -m venv py3.10
```

Step 2. Navigate to the Scripts directory inside the virtual environment directory.
```
cd py3.10\Scripts
```

Step 3. Run the activation script based on your command prompt type.
   * For Command Prompt:
      ```
      activate
      ```

   * For PowerShell:
      ```
      .\Activate
      ```

Step 4. You can deactivate the Python virtual environment when you finish your exercises. 
```
deactivate
```
